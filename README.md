# cbt-idea-plugin

a simple implementation of *.iml file generator IDEA scala projects.

This project works with some assumptions right now (will be eventually addressed): 
  * iml file will be generated by executing ```cbt generateIdeaProject```
  * the path of cbt's comaptibility,stage1 & stage2 are injected / hardcoded in the resulting iml file
